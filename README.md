# A. File Manager Simulation in C, an Implementation of Tree Data Structure

> Simple and modular tree data structure implemented in C. Supports dynamic memory allocation, insertion, traversal, and deletion.

## B. Features

#### 1. File Manager Simulation
- Use bash command
- help command to show all the valid commands, and show you how to use them

#### 2. Tree
- Node-based tree structure using `struct`
- Dynamic memory allocation with `malloc`/`free`
- Pre-order, Post-order, and In-order traversal
- Clean and modular code
- Easy to extend (e.g., for binary trees, N-ary trees, etc.)

## C. Project Structure
- main file         =>  main program
- treeNode files    =>  responsible in tree data structure
- queue files       =>  required to do traversal by level
- command files     =>  responsible in valid commands to manipulate folders
- secureInput       =>  responsible in regulating user input
- common files      =>  to do some common tasks (ex: clear screen, print errir, etc)
